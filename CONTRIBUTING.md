## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/hyperweavers/nidhi/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the applications, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you [create a new Issue](https://github.com/hyperweavers/nidhi/issues/new/choose), a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), that means that all code changes happen through Pull Requests. Pull Requests are a way to propose changes to the codebase and get feedback from the maintainers. Here’s how to [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/hyperweavers/nidhi/pulls):

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch from the `main` branch.
4. Make your changes.
5. Ensure the test suite passes, code lints and commit your changes.
6. Push your changes to your forked repository.
7. Create a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.
8. Wait for the maintainers to review your Pull Request and provide feedback.
9. Make any necessary changes based on the feedback and then push your changes to your forked repository.
10. Once the maintainers have approved your Pull Request, they will merge it into the `main` branch of the original repository.
